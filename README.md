# Embedded Systems
Playing with embedded systems using Arduino, Ti Launchpads, 
MAiX Bit, Raspberry Pi and others using different Operating Systems.

Basically the idea is to learn to use these small devices and learn to dominate them.

After some initial learning, a single architecture should be used. This architecture should
be the RISC-V ISA if nothing really speaks against it.

The idea is to get some experience using architectures with increasing complexity.

Arduino TM4C

ESP32

RISC-V (Maix Bit, ESP32S3, Longan)
- There are no real tutorials/books available

An alternative line is the RP2040 and RaspberryPi

Large Scale Projects: Self driving car, self driving drone
